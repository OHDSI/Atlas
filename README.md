**ATLAS** is an open source software tool for researchers to conduct scientific analyses on standardized observational data converted to the [OMOP Common Data Model V5](https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/wiki "OMOP Common Data Model V5"). Researchers can create cohorts by defining groups of people based on an exposure to a drug or diagnosis of a particular condition using healthcare claims data. ATLAS has vocabulary searching of medical concepts to identify people with specific conditions, drug exposures etc. Patient profiles can be viewed within a specific cohort allowing visualization of a particular subject's health care records. Population effect level estimation analyses allows for comparison of two different cohorts and leverages R packages.
