**ATLAS** is an open source software tool for researchers to conduct scientific analyses on patient-level healthcare data standardized to the [OMOP Common Data Model V5](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/ "OMOP Common Data Model V5"). Researchers can create cohorts by defining groups of people based on an exposure to a drug or diagnosis of a particular condition using healthcare claims data. ATLAS has vocabulary searching of medical concepts to identify people with specific conditions, drug exposures etc. More information on ATLAS is found in [Chapter 8 in the Book of OHDSI](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/OhdsiAnalyticsTools.html).

The vision for ATLAS is to provide a common set of study design tools that are capable of running one or more [HADES](https://ohdsi.github.io/Hades/) analytical R packages.
